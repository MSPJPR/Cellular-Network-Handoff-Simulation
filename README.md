# Cellular-Network-Handoff-Simulation

website link:https://mspjpr.github.io/Cellular-Network-Handoff-Simulation/

Objective

The project simulates handoff scenarios in a cellular network, demonstrating how users (e.g., mobile devices) move between overlapping cells. It evaluates performance metrics like handoff events, call drop rates, and user connectivity across the network.

Key Features

1. Dynamic Visualization

Displays multiple cells and users moving within the network.

Visualizes handoff between cells as the user moves.



2. Handoff Mechanism

Simulates both soft handoff (connection maintained with multiple cells) and hard handoff (instant switch to a new cell).



3. Performance Tracking

Logs handoff events in real time with details like timestamp, user position, and connected cell.



4. Interactive Interface

Control user speed dynamically.

Add or remove cells during the simulation.

Reset the simulation for a fresh start.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the web application.

CSS: Styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: Core simulation logic and interactivity.

Canvas API: Real-time graphics rendering.

How It Works

1. Initialization

Cells: Represented as circles with specific coverage areas.

User: A moving point (mobile device) that interacts with cells based on its position.


2. Handoff Simulation

The simulation tracks the user's position relative to cell boundaries.

When the user enters a new cell's coverage area, a handoff event is triggered.

Logs record the handoff details for performance analysis.


3. User Control

Adjust the speed of user movement using a slider.

Dynamically add or remove cells to test various scenarios.

Learning Outcomes

1. Understanding Cellular Handoff:

Explore how algorithms manage seamless transitions between cells in networks like GSM, LTE, and 5G.



2. Real-Time Visualization:

Learn to use the Canvas API to render dynamic network components.



3. Performance Metrics Analysis:

Evaluate handoff efficiency, user experience, and network reliability.



4. Interactive Frontend Development:

Build an interactive user interface with JavaScript and CSS.

Applications

Demonstrates the importance of handoff in real-world cellular networks.

Can be extended to include handoff algorithms (e.g., signal strength-based, distance-based).

Useful for academic projects, teaching, and research on wireless communication systems.
